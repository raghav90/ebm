Contributing code
=================

If you intend to work on this repo and make some changes, please can you let the 
group know what youâ€™re going to work on before you start. This will hopefully 
prevent multiple people working on the same thing, making the merge process a 
bit easier.

How to contribute
-----------------
The preferred way to contribute to ebm is to fork the 
[main repository](https://github.com/ucl-pond/ebm) on
GitHub:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/ucl-pond/ebm):
   click on the 'Fork' button at the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

          $ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubLogin/ebm.git
          [enter username and password as requested]
          $ cd ebm

3. Create a branch to hold your changes:

          $ git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work in the ``master`` branch!

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version
   control. When you're done editing, do:

          $ git add modified_files
          $ git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with:

          $ git push -u origin my-feature

These steps can also be recreated using a Git GUI, for example 
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
